        <p>I currently work at <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.apple.com" target="_blank">Apple</a>, where I lead a design team. Previously, I was an early hire at <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.fleetsmith.com/fleetsmith-acquired-by-apple" target="_blank">Fleetsmith (acquired by Apple</a>), where I led design, developed the design team, created their design system in partnership with engineering, and worked with founders on vision.</p>

        <p>Before Fleetsmith, I worked at <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>, where I designed for macOS and web. Before Dropbox, I was a founding member of the web design systems and styles team at <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.twitch.tv/" target="_blank">Twitch</a>.</p>

        <p>I received my B.S. in Computer Science from <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://engineering.nyu.edu" target="_blank">NYU Tandon School of Engineering</a>, while I worked at <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.tendigi.com" target="_blank">Tendigi</a>, a design agency in Brooklyn. I grew up on Long Island, NY, where I ate bagels, played Zelda, and went to the beach.</p>
