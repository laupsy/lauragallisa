            <h1>I'm Laura Gallisá, a technical design lead based in NY.</h1>
            <p>I currently lead a design team at <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.apple.com" target="_blank">Apple</a>. Previously, I was an early hire at <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.fleetsmith.com/fleetsmith-acquired-by-apple" target="_blank">Fleetsmith (acquired by Apple)</a>, where I led design, developed the design team, created their design system in partnership with engineering, where I built components and documentation with React, built their marketing site, helped to hire and craft CSS & systems thinking interviews for front-end developers, and worked with founders on vision.</p>

            <p>Before Fleetsmith, I worked at <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.dropbox.com/" target="_blank">Dropbox</a>, where I designed for macOS and web, developed for Android, and built landing pages. Before Dropbox, I was a founding member of the web design systems and styles team at <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.twitch.tv/" target="_blank">Twitch</a>, where I built components and documentation, and built their <a href="https://dribbble.com/shots/2524193-Twitch-2015-Retrospective" target="_blank">2015 retrospective</a> with JS and CSS animations. </p>

            <p>I received my B.S. in Computer Science from <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://engineering.nyu.edu" target="_blank">NYU Tandon School of Engineering</a>, while I worked at <a rel="noreferrer" href="https://www.tendigi.com" target="_blank">Tendigi</a>, a design agency in Brooklyn. I grew up on Long Island, NY, where I ate bagels, played Zelda, and went to the beach.</p>
