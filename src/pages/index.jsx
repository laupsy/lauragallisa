              I care about designing conscientious experiences that are delightfully accessible to everyone. My generative approach starts by identifying the problem that needs to be solved, and then analyzes optimizations and trade-offs of potential solutions before making an opinionated decision on the right solution.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              Problems are solved in both the interface and in the technical infrastructure, which is why I work closely with the engineers on my team to achieve the best possible outcome.
            </Paragraph>
            <Paragraph>
              I value transparency and emphasize taking balanced mental and physical care at work. Involving all functions in the design process is especially important, as the best solutions are discovered by cross-functional teams. I believe that experiences should be self-aware; design doesn&apos;t exist in a vacuum, it exists alongside all of the emotions,
              environments, and scenarios that exist in a person&apos;s life.
