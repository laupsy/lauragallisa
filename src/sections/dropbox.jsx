          At Dropbox I primarily worked on a new desktop experience{" "}

          </span>{" "}
          where I owned the end-to-end user funnel, product positioning, drove
          key activation &amp; retention metrics, and owned the web &amp;
          Android apps. I also helped to run the new grad designer program.

          I also designed onboarding for Dropbox Home to introduce useful new
          ways to retrieve files.

      I also explored ways to incorporate our new brand into the product,
      ranging from iconography sets to an internal particles library in native
      Swift, which was quickly adopted in various onboarding screens and
      tooltips.

      I also launched multiple landing pages for various projects{" "}

      . One featured stars and constellations, built by dynamically generating
      objects on an HTML5 canvas and using a shortest path formula create the
      effect of constellations.
